Question 1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer: Remote repository is needed when we want various persons to work, share, and collaborate to one project.

Question 2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: Pulling changes manually lets the user to decides if they need the commit made on remote or not. Eg: Sometimes they might work/experiment on new features which are not based on new commits on remote.
